# it.cuturl
This is an open, free to use (can be also self-hosted) url shortner built on VueJS & Vuetify for frontend and PHP on backend.
At the time being, it already has quite a few (also a bit unique) features and we do have plans to add even more.
If you want to contribute, you're very welcome to do so :)
